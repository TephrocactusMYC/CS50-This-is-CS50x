If songs.db contains the top 100 songs of one listener from 2018, how would you characterize their audio aura?

To describe the audio atmosphere of a certain audience, we need to first determine some factors that may affect their music preferences. These factors may include music genre, song rhythm, lyrics theme, singer and so on. We can determine their audio atmosphere by analyzing these factors. For example, if most of the audience's top 100 songs are pop music, then we can say that their audio atmosphere is popular. If most songs are fast-paced, then we can say that their audio atmosphere is energetic. If the themes of the songs are all about love and breakup, then we can say that their audio atmosphere is romantic.

Hypothesize about why the way youâ€™ve calculated this aura might not be very representative of the listener. What better ways of calculating this aura would you propose?

Our method of calculating the audio atmosphere may not be accurate enough, as it only considers the number and type of songs, without taking into account other factors such as audience mood, cultural background, social circle, etc. In addition, if the audience only listens to one type of music, we may draw incorrect conclusions that they only like this type of music. Therefore, we need more data and more complex algorithms to calculate the audio atmosphere. For example, we can analyze aspects such as song lyrics, emotions and rhythms to better understand the audience's music preferences. We can also combine their music preferences with their social media behavior and other datasets for a more comprehensive analysis.
